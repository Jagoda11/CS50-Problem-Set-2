# CS50 Problem Set 2 🚀

Welcome to my CS50 Problem Set 2 repository! This set dives into the world of cryptography, featuring two classic ciphers implemented in C. Let's encrypt and decrypt messages in style! 🎉

## Caesar Cipher 🔐

- **Filename:** `caesar.c`
- **Description:** This program encrypts messages using the Caesar cipher, one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It shifts each letter by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet, wrapping around as necessary. 🔄

## Vigenère Cipher 📜

- **Filename:** `vigenere.c`
- **Description:** Taking a step further into the realm of cryptography, the Vigenère cipher uses a keyword to shift each letter in the plaintext, offering a more secure encryption method. Unlike Caesar's fixed shift, Vigenère's shift varies, making it a polyalphabetic cipher. 🗝️

## Getting Started 🏁

To run these encryption programs, clone the repository and compile each program using `clang` or `make`. Provide a key as a command-line argument when executing the program, and then enter the plaintext you wish to encrypt.

Example for Caesar:
./caesar 13


Example for Vigenère:
./vigenere keyword


## Dive into Cryptography 🤿

These programs offer a hands-on experience with basic cryptography concepts. By exploring these ciphers, you'll gain insights into historical encryption methods and their modern significance.


Feel free to explore
Happy Coding! 💻
